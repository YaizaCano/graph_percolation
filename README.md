## Directory structure ##
This project is structured into 7 main folders
  <li><b>src/</b> Contains all the code of the project including and the necessary files to compile it
             and run it</li>
  <li><b>docs/</b> Contains the documentation of the code, the documentation has a code
              documentation in html that was created using Doxygen, and the documentation of the

## Compilation & execution ##
To compile the code you need to run  the Makefile with<br>
  ``` make```

To execute it has to be run with the specified parameters in usage<br>

  ``` Usage: ./program n seed outputDir

    n: the total number of vertices
    seed: the random seed for the data generation
    dim: number of dimensions for geometric graphs
    stepSize: the step size of probability q
    outputDir: the directory where the experiment must be placed, the directory must exist
